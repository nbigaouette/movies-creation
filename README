I often have to create a movie out of PNGs created from a simulation run. The
choice of a video codec and container is a complicated one: you never know
if a specific machine will be able to play the video.

Thanks to open source, we now have a free (as in free speech!) solution.
There is Theora video compression (the codec, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theora)
contained inside an Ogg container (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg).
But a better video compression should be VP8 from On2 (bought by Google). After
the acquisition Google released WebM, which is VP8 for video compression
contained inside the Matroska container.
